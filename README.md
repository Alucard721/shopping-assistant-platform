# shopping-assistant-platform

A shopping assistant platform that collects product data from major e-commerce platforms to provide price comparisons and product recommendations.

## Project Background

### Background:

With the rapid advancement of internet technologies and the acceleration of global trade, e-commerce has quickly become a vital part of the global economy. Attracted by its convenience, a growing number of consumers are turning to online shopping—especially with the rise of mobile payments and social media marketing.

Major platforms such as JD.com, Taobao have emerged, bringing with them a surge of merchants. While this has offered consumers greater variety and convenience, it has also introduced two major challenges:

1. Consumers often find it difficult to make decisions due to the need to switch between multiple platforms. Even for the same product, price and quality can vary significantly across different sites, making the process time-consuming and inefficient—undermining the core value of online shopping.

2. The lack of standardized evaluation systems and the prevalence of fake reviews make it hard for consumers to assess product authenticity and quality. This leads to poor purchase decisions and dissatisfaction, as low-quality or counterfeit products may be bought based on misleading information.

### Objective:

Addressing issues mentioned in the background by building a shopping assistant platform that collects product data across platforms, enables precise price comparison, and provides reliable product recommendations to support better consumer decision-making.

## How It's Made:

Tech used: Spring Boot, Selenium, Lucene, Vue, Electron.
